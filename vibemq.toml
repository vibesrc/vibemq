# VibeMQ Configuration Example
# Copy this file to vibemq.toml and customize as needed
#
# Environment Variables:
#
# 1. In-file substitution using ${VAR} or ${VAR:-default} syntax:
#    bind = "${MQTT_HOST:-0.0.0.0}:${MQTT_PORT:-1883}"
#    password = "${ADMIN_PASSWORD}"
#
# 2. Override any field with VIBEMQ__ prefixed env vars (double underscore):
#    VIBEMQ__SERVER__BIND=0.0.0.0:1884
#    VIBEMQ__LIMITS__MAX_CONNECTIONS=50000
#    VIBEMQ__AUTH__ENABLED=true
#    VIBEMQ__MQTT__MAX_QOS=1
