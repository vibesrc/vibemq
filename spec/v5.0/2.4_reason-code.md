# 2.4 Reason Code

A Reason Code is a one byte unsigned value that indicates the result of an operation. Reason Codes less than 0x80 indicate successful completion of an operation. The normal Reason Code for success is 0. Reason Code values of 0x80 or greater indicate failure.

The CONNACK, PUBACK, PUBREC, PUBREL, PUBCOMP, DISCONNECT and AUTH Control Packets have a single Reason Code as part of the Variable Header. The SUBACK and UNSUBACK packets contain a list of one or more Reason Codes in the Payload.

The Reason Codes share a common set of values as shown below.

**Non-normative comment**

For Reason Code 0x91 (Packet identifier in use), the response to this is either to try to fix the state, or to reset the Session state by connecting using Clean Start set to 1, or to decide if the Client or Server implementations are defective.
